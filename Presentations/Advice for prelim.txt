Make sure I understand what question they are asking:
"I think the answer you're asking is..."

"I don't know the answer to that question, but here's a
related one". 

John: (r-1)^2

There are multipler drivers of differente cell types
One possibility is EC, has some applicability about retina/sensory, maybe less for other parts of brain

John: What does EC hae to do with cell types? slide title 

Previous student did this on static chromatic, we only got
2 cell tyopes
When she did that with time, the more neurons the model,
the more cell types emerges 

Hypothesis: If you go to color, you'll see a simpler
effect with chromatic cell types 

Approach:
What is the model, what am I going to do,
what do I expect to happen, what do I do if that goes wrong
