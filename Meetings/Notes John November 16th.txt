- Should call the function three times, instad of having
that function work on. 
- Use mapping to do that 


Double check that we're integrating into the right number of dimensions 

When sokmething is bolded, it is a vector
When the same variable is written unbolded, it is the norm of that vector

Values in v2 are power spectral density: "Energy" in fourier space

bfgs - uses Hessian, pretty good but can't work with large data

B^T B = 1 
^ COnstraint on B matrix, to transform
