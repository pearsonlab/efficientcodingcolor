John: Understand why tensorboard plots the matrices so weird 
So we can look how they change over time 

***Greg: Add 1 sd deviation (center) of each DoG in the mosaics.
That's very nice to have 

Gray might be one than one cluster
Might want to cluster points by hand

Yellow and orange are hard to see 

***John: 
Actually check that your algorithm works mid-training
instead of waiting until the end!!!!!


***John
Do the same analysis for unparametrized
HARD
Need some way to figure out that fit is garbage because
RF is garbage 
Pick a few examples and work with them until I'm happy with it
1 example that's good, one that's terrible, one for each problem
e.g. border, weird green ones, etc

Patience function: Might want to hard code hit 
Could smooth function (or not)
*Talk to Daniela about this 

*Smooth gradients over time? 
By doing that, I get better estimates of the gradients
Bias/variance tradeoff

PCA whiten eigenchannels,
slowly reduce the whitening to normal images 

*Question: If I whiten images, do I get 6 "clean" mosaics?
