Line 38: Why would the brain uses same principles 
for pre-cortical vs cortical stages? Question is not 
very strong. 

Line 62: "Given
63 these various objectives, it is still not clear what constraints are actually
64 operating in the specification of the retinal coding system"
Their model is not unique, and previous research has shown
DoG receptive fields using these constraints (e.g. Simoncelli,
Nayoung). 

Main criticism: Constraint on wiring (L2 regularization)
is not needed to get DoG RFs. (line 89)

line 97: Considering that photoreceptors cones are LMS,
it is confusing to note photoreceptors as L and 
RGCs as M. 

Major Line 116: Having more assumptions is a bad thing, but
they try to sell it as a good thing. You don't need
decorrelation because its part of efficient coding. 

128: Are three assumptions really necessary???

Typo 154: You would get that from GLM, not reverse correlation,
because your inputs aren't white noise (?). 

Line 181: They say that their RFs aren't ON center and
OFF center. I am confused by this. 

Line 221: They confused sparseness of connections
and sparseness of firing rates. 


Figure 5: Only looking at color RFs using RGB can be misleading. E.g. What looks like a blue center RF
can be due to +S center or -L -M center.
