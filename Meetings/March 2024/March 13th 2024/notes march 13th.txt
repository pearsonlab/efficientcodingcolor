John: Fix rescaling by having "center" be 0,0


- Greg: Compute radial energy function on these mosaics 
Peter Diggle: 2D point processes (or spatial statistics). 
*Read Suvah's paper (By Greg & John). 
Greg has a worldwide talk on YT that goes through this energy stuff. 

John: Plot what RFs are. Ask him later for details*
L channel: Add all pixels for every neuron. 



John: When reducing noise, mosaics become aligned! (Greg says its "extremely cool" :))
For the 2nd experiment, make sure that the thing converged properly.
*Jittering: Have a 2D matrix that rotates the d parameters. Have a small perturbation. 

Hypothesis: ON and OFF lock in very quickly, other mosaics take longer. 
Look at tensorboard + run analysis on earlier checkpoints/model saves.

***Take one of the color channel (in the formed mosaics) and multiply it by -1. 
Force it to be opponent. Can do this offline and retrain model
Do that 1st ** 


John: Check if opponent cells are next to each other. 

Double-check by eye
