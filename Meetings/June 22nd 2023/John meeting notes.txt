- Check if images are L2 normed each channel or the entire stack: DONE, they are normalized (Z scored) across the entire stack. 
- Ask Greg what RGB conversion matrix he prefers DONE: 1-to-1 conversion.

Analysis:
- John is wondering what two x that are close in the mosaic. Are those different? 
DONE: Analysis.neighbors. Yellow ON/OFF vs Blue big gaussian 

Have 3D scatterplot of LMS L2 Norm. Can do the same with center values.
Let's investigate c and d. 6 values per neurons, can do PCA to reduce dimensionality. Show him top 2 PCs. 





John: When I talk about a, b, c and d, we want the actual values, not what we train. 
Create function to convert the input values to their actual values. 
DONE

Check how long NSERC application. 
DONE


Note to self: Analyse a, b c and d.
