Its unclear why the gamma constraint has more MI

John: What I'm doing to fix h_exp should be less clever.
Track r without the gain instead of multiplying by h_exp

Do a small experiment to test that the idea works 


2- Check that all W have L2-norm of 1. 
I wonder if the mean are close to the max. 

- Covariance matrix
I need to look at the raw values instead of relying on tensorboard 


- The reason why I get higher MI on the gamma model might be because of higher overfitting
** Very important to figure out why I get higher MI with the gamma model
Check MI before and after fixing the gains. Should be worse after gamma constraint 
Check that MI isn't worse off after gradient + change in gamma. 

* Maybe try a smaller learning rate ? (not really) 


*** High priority, plot the mosaics. 

*Get a full data calculation since I'm done with training. Post-trainng analysis


****** By default pytorch takes a gradient off the gain.
