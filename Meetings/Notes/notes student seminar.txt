Need a cocktail party pitch - first slide 
then its background slides - need to explain gap in knowledge 

Dont forget to have a slide about weaknesses at the end 

Have some backup slides for questions people may ask - in case I am short on time 

Make presentation understandable for wide audience 
Make intro and conclusion first - tie back theads from the beginning at the end 

- Have outline and come back to it and gray out what I went through 

***Have title for every slide 

David: Explain LM model instead of STA******


---------------------------------------------

What's cool about the paper is that they can replicate so many things, and generate hypotheses
I should mention most findings and show that the model replicates it 

Explain ON and OFF pathways
Use retina figure to introduce ON and OFF pathways (ionotropic vs metabotropic receptors decide ON vs OFF) 
Pathways arise at bipolar cells level 

Add ON and OFF bipolar cell on the figure 

Change STA slide to a LM slide 
Can be done with white noise OR natural image (pros and cons of both) 
LM model is a black box between input and output, but CNN allows us to infer the computations in between 

****The gap in knowledge: LM model is a black box, but what's in between? CNN answers this question! 
LM models work best with very simple stimuli
