1. Try to reproduce mosaics DoG with black and white with our modificaitons **
2. Check how kernels evolve over time - Make sure that kernel centers change over time **. Use Shape instead of shape_module to create 
RFs from DoG to have the kernel centers in as well. 


*** Could be that rr in Nayoung's code and rr in my code are DIFFERENT
Nayoung should be noramlizing rr between 0 and 1. 

3. Check that output images are normalized to 1 (after shape module). Can do that by checking L2 norm of output of shape module



****** Need to recalculate the data covariance. Need to be using the lms data covariance
18^2 x 18^2 x 3


Cleaner coding: Use same shape module for both black and white and color modules. Take n_colors as input to this function. 
Fold Color1 and Color2 into the same module. 

Improvement: When I create something that I'm trying to get to work, make a new Git branch. 
Its called "Version controlled". 
Its more secure.
