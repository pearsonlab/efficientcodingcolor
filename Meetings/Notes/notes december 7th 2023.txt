- See the plot of the mosaic
- Maybe surrounds are still balanced but mroe spread out

-What is the difference between h and r in tensorboard?
Why is r double h in the new method?
Track down: Is the constraint firing rate at 2 instead of 1?

Big question: Why is MI up during centering and jittering? 
Centering increases image power by 1.4
Makes the center stronger and the RF smaller
Maybe making the RF smaller increases MI, and that's why its up
during centering/jittering
