What are the eigenchannels 

5: Why G0? G0 is the maximum frequency you can handle with a specific mosaic size
Unit cell of the dual lettuce* (look up what that means) 
Why k + g? 
Look at Nayoung's paper to understand why G0 is an eigenfunction 
G is within G0. k + g is because of alised frequencies 
Has something to do with the circles 
G0 is a domain, max of G0 = (2*pi/delta z)

6: What's C'? 
Left side is V^T*C*V
C' is a vector (e.g. [50,30,20]) that tells the distribution of color channels 

C_ab is the fourier transform of Cx
C_ab(k) is 3x3, there's one for each k (spatial frequency). So its infinite 

14: Why VA + 1 and not VA + V?


Assumption in the multiple mosaic case:
All mosaics have the same SF. Makes math simpler! 

Note: If its not bold its not a matrix
