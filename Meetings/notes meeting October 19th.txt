Horizontal are simple
Vertical are complex 
Vertical are 3-4 times the RF size of the horizontal

Not all ON-OFF cells are direction-selective


For direction-selective dendrites (amacrine cells):
Euler, Detwiler, Denk

Greg idea:
Use model from Pillow to estimate spatiotemporal RFs
STA that's tilted in space-time


1- Figure out linear case
2- Check whether we're close to optimal solution (not perfect mosaic)
3- Tune down learning rate as you get closer to optimum

John: The restriction on firing rate is for every neuron
NOT on the population 

Greg idea: 
Use VAR to reconstruct motion in natural images 
Hope we can find ON-OFF DSGC


I love that idea:
Bake-in direction selectivity and look if we can replicate how these are distributed across the population
We could: See if the set of natural movies matters
