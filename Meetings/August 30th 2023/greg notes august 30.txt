Greg: Fovea midget cells only have L and M cone in the center. 
Surround has L + M

Blue-yellow cells in the retina do have 'opponency' in the center, because
yellow OFF center is slightly bigger. 

**Color the new plots by each mosaic 

**Idea: Try to make the mosaics of different density and see how the influences color opponency
1/1/4 split 

Combine fixed kernel centers while manipulating variance in red/green axis 

Pick different cone for each pixel
David: Have to find a way to lower resolution somehow 

8 to 10% of cones are S cones. Pretty regular hexagonal latice. 
Rest is a weighted coin flip between L and P (probability is not 45% for everyone, it changes
from individual to individual. Some people have 10 times more L than M cones. other 
extreme is 2 times more M than L).
