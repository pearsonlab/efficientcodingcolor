1. Need to change vfun (output 4) to output spatial frequency x channel 

2. Need to change A (in Cx formula) to be a matrix (3x3) 
instead of a scalar 

3. Formula 22 and 23 are the ones that change 
Rotate Cx to be in eigenchannel coordinates 
Can either diagonalize A or Cx, its same thing
For diagonal A, for each value in diagonal I run output 4. 

I compute power, then I unrotate it to the original basis. 

4. I have to decide a value for nu 
Plot the three filters, they are going to look different. 


The reason why marginal information gain per neuron graph
is different is probably because I'm in a different 
parameter regime.
The fact the other graph is linear means I am not getting
diminishing returns. 

5. Most important thing right now is to get the spatial filters.
We don't really need everything else right now. 

To do (10), I use a generalized eigenvalue method.
