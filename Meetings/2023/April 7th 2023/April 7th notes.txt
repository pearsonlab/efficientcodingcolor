-PCA variance: divide by total "variance of three channels

- Retina has S ON and LM OFF bipolar cells 

The bump at 500k might be due to some jittering in Nayoung's code. 
She multiplted all the kernels by a number bigger than 1. 
Simulating something


Pull up radial profiles for next meeting 


Its interesting to Greg that S channel has a surround mechanism; experiment with SF to test that!

THe reason why 200 RGCs have bad surround is because of bad optimization; need more jittering!

Will probably need more parametrization to increase RGCs drastically to get red/green receptive field.
