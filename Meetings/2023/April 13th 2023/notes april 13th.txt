Double-check that blue ON also have yellow OFF at same location

- Have different non-linearity for every color channel 

- Could also plot each channel separately 

- Lets run 200 RGCs with more than 1.5m epochs - let's check in tensorboard if the RFs are still changing


Johns thinks the 100 RGCs mosaics haven't fully settled because some RFs are smaller 

Nayoung usually has proportional number of steps to RGCs - so 2m epochs (at least) 

John: At some point we have to parametrize more so we can run more models faster and easier 

Nayoung: One of the reasons why I get ON/OFF receptive field might have to do with the auto-correlation for some colors being wider than others
