- Average over a few pixels for the clustering, the colors may or may not hold up

Greg: Look at radial average. 
Do PCA over concatenated radial plots 
Every PC gets a pair of mosaics 
* Can normalize distance by size, or can keep it og. Its a decision to make, should try it both ways
* Should look at spread of a and b to make that decision 

Note: We need to understand what the surrounds do!! ***

The reason why I use 5% GPU might be because the model is too large and not everything fits on GPU?

Reason why the covariance matrix doesnt fully align with point might beb ecause we lack spatial information

Greg: Normalize the corr x dist plot by RF size 
John: Look if plots are normally distributed for any dist 
Greg: Split this plot by cell type (for orange)
Big and small RFs are clumped together and that might be why we see this "surround" effect. 
For this type, calculate the average RF size and normalize by that. 
SD of center is what will make sense. Look at how SD varies across all three color channels and base my decision on that. Default would be to average. 
John: When you average parameters across channels, weight them by d. 

John: center color plot
Problem that I approximate center values

*** Do machine learning 12x12, but do analysis with 100x100 pixels!

John: Look how much RFs vary within one cluster. 

Me: Look at whether a (precision of center) varies within cluster.
