- Should call the function three times, instad of having
that function work on. 
- Use mapping to do that 


Double check that we're integrating into the right number of dimensions 

When sokmething is bolded, it is a vector
When the same variable is written unbolded, it is the norm of that vector

Values in v2 are power spectral density: "Energy" in fourier space 

fconmin
scipy.optimize.minimize 
Nelder-mead
bfgs - uses Hessian, pretty good but can't work with large data

B^T B = 1 
^ COnstraint on B matrix, to transform 
-----------------
January 4th 2024:

B has 6 parameters. 3 real, real complex
u(111) has 6 parts two, but all the complex are ezro. 

Problem has 12 variables, 12 equations?
9 equations from B^T B = 1
3 equations from the diag thing 

1. Function that takes v and spits out u
2. Functions that takes v and spits out information
