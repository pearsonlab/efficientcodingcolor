** Figure out why adding gain parameter reduces MI drasticallyjjjjj

Calculate correlations of firing rates
between one mosaic and another. 

Get correlation matrix 300x300
Look at how those values change as a function of distance
Make one plot like this for every pair of mosaic. 


** Try to figure out why firing rates
go up when I flip one channel. That makes no sense. 


* Do a 80/20 split with two channels. 
Show images. Look at what images look like when I zero M channel
