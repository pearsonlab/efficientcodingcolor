Look at Surround strength in -L or +S clusters. 

John: Always look at intermediate steps*

Greg observation: Unchanged clusters form better mosaics
after I flip the other clusters. 

John plot: Before and after plots in PC space. 
It would be really cool to look at that over time. 
Take one common PC space from the start (right before
manipulation). 

Greg: Do PC on both the start and end RFs. 
Each cell is represented twice. 

David: Trying to add both ON and both OFF channel 
see if that improves the mosaic 

***John: Estimate MI over 1 epoch (entire dataset). 

John: Reason why Firing rate goes up at reverse
might be because all neurons fire at the same time 
when there's a chromatic discrepancy.


Do statistics on MI
Estimate MI at the end of training before and after modification
Estimate error bars using 

**Look at spatial locations of -S RFs. 

Look at neuron closest to a +L neuron, and see if this one lacks
a surround

What is the symmetry that breaks this? 
Can I calculate something about the images that suggest
something about symmetry?
Can I change something in the images that breaks this 
asymmetry?

Easy check: Reverse both L and S channels.
