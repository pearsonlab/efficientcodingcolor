I can increase L - S dimension by projecting L and S to L+S and L-S
, then multiply it by a diagonal matrix. Then rotate it back. 

Add RFs and MI into the checks for presentations in general

John's idea:
Check how each channel responds to natural images as a function of mosaic.
How does increasing opponency change responses of each channel/mosaic?

How orthogonal are RFs from 2 mosaics?

John's other idea:
What happens if I fix the first 2 mosaics to be perfectly luminance only?
John doesn't think I should not remove grad.
