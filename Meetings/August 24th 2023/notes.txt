-Greg: Look at what the images look like (sanity check, something weird might be going on!)
- Just make sure that there is no clipping 
David: Triple check that there isn't a bug somewhere? idk 

John forget space, try to solve this on paper 
We could simulate a super simple small model 

John & Greg: Compute 3x3 correlation matrix for the transformed data 

***Greg: Have more than one mosaic when we fix the centers
Have 6 of them, all have the same centers 

John's advice: Not a bad idea to stop model after a couple hours to check if everything runs well 

Gaussian mixture: Plot the ellipsoid over the points, visualization trick! 

When doing clustering, decide how many PCs based on variance each of them explains. 

John: It really helps to have a worksheet with all the papers you've read about a topic

**Read all the Baccus papers
Greg Field x pillow lab

1- Train kernel centers
2- Train different pca color split
3- Get a different machine!!!
