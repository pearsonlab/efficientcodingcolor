Always show MI plot when I make new plot. 
Plot was confusing: Plot what the reader cares about. 
We care more about MI without the constraint than with. 

use same bins for each histogram
np.histogram()

Try halving both noises and see if that changes anything.
In general: Start searching noise parameter space to see if that increases
color opponency. 
Greg's intuition: Should be fairly robust to change in output noise.
Input noise should change it. 

John: While exploring, its good to use an init state. 
Loss should be smooth. 

*Greg: In real physiology, we also need to increase contrast to see surround. 

**John idea:
Sample more of the +L -S images. 
Can also rotate them by a 90 degree angle. 

Maybe get rid of outliers in either direction! 

** There's a great tool for linking mosaics with RFs. Ask bird people about this!

****Take 50% of the images and flip the L S channels. (Good control). 
L channel becomes the S channel, and vice-versa with 50% odds. 
Reflecting points around the 1:1 axis. 

Check where the peaks in last slide come from

Greg: Might be interesting to just flip one channel
so they are anti-correlated 
Playing with noise is also valuable

The strategy in my theory is ineffective if the output noise is high.
Its a way to change my theory.
