- Label ON and OFF
- Make sure scale doesn't change with epochs 

- Make sure every h bug has been fixed in efficientcodingcolor

- Try to make gamma way slower. Low learning rate
makes it so that firing rate is not always 1. 

Check if gain oscillates 

- Histogram gains per epoch. See how that distribution changes
Plot gains for single neurons.

The model also adjusts the threshold. That's the problem!

- Use a learning rate that's 5x or 10x faster than the W rate
- Might also need a slow training rate for the constraint
and then its faster. The gradient can't be too large 
otherwise you overstep 

Could also turn down learning rate without the new cool
constraint
