Meeting in person with Greg and John on Tuesday at noon.

Look at more example of zero-crossings and see if I agree with them visually
Consider doing 1 per channel and aggregating 


#################
If we look at coactivation properties of mosaics, we might understand why they
stop moving when not forming a perfect mosaic. 

1. How correlated all RFs are. Correlation matrix
2. Binarize activity. Correlation matrix (how often they are active). 
3. How strongly do they correlate when they are active. 
###########################

Can consider re-computing MI after changing on parameter. 
Try to understand single scenarios why kernel centers (or color weights) do not move
Why has it converged? If we move it, what does it conflict with? 


You're allowed to take different inputs from each channel to average out noise. 
Thats why we get 4 mosaics in the monochromatic case

Can parametrize a to be a sigmoid, thing to consider eventually (not right now). 


Greg experiments:
1- Go back to 1 channel case (full monochrome case, actually Nayoung's model)
(Then work your way back up to 3 channels)
2- Focus on 2 channels
