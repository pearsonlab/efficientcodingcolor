- Really need more citations. Use numbers

- Highlight 80% of midget cells instead of color opponency
- We're in a privileged spot to study allocation across mosaics
- Have figure with retina diagram. Explain photoreceptors, bipolar cells, RGCs, ON and OFF 
- New models are more general. Less assumptions


- Its better to say: EC has been successful in the retina at X, Y or Z
X, Y and Z all have many citations 

2nd paragraph: Retina background, then EC-retina background 
3rd paragraph: What the present is (Simoncelli, us) 

- Figure. X is not a multiplication symbol 

Maybe: Add images behidn the stack 
- Copy Nayoung's general structure
- Have arrow from X to Y -> Maximize mutual information 

Aim:
Rationale 
Preliminary data 
EC model can explain why the retina works X way 

- PRevious work in our lab showed that RFs in space and time form multiple types
- Hwoever there were no motion selective cells, which we know exist.
- I assume that this is because of a technical reason, which I think will give us motion selective work. 
** Do not talk about separability. Previous model just used a simpler form that limits RFs. We will remove this assumption 
and generalize the model.

Have one sentence: I propose to generalize that model to space-time inseparable RFs (citations!!!!! for definition).
