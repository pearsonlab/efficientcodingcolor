Review of what they did with Nayoung
- This is what has changed, it let us do that. This allows us to test X hypotheses
^ Half a page

- Two aims. Description. More extensive than specific aims.
More background about problem, technical background
Each aim is half a page 


Overall: 1 figure in the whole thing. Should encapsulate both of my aims

Core limitation of Atick & Redlich is that its linear 
Instead of saying its biologically plausible, say "realistic constraints"
Pencil & Paper: Can't do that with everything
Using al inear model, they were able to solve things analytically
New: Tractable computational models, that can be optimized. (Simoncelli). Can take advantage of machine learning
That allows us to solve problems that can't be done in pencil paper
