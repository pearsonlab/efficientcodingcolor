Show the findings from the original paper 
Motion anticipation, talk about integration over time 

Clearly distinguish ON and OFF pathway to excitation/inhibition 
*********

Do NOT confuse interneuron with bipolar cells, please!!! Very confusing 
I should use subunit instead 


Miles: Have more animations!!! Natural images
Slide 5, block the modeling unless you get to it 

Slide 5: Do not jump from bottom to top back and forth. Only explain one thing at a time

Miles: The black box analogy isn't that good. Its more about inferring whats in the middle 



John: 
1. I'm missing out the conversation the paper gets at 
Provide a unified computtional account of what the retina is doing 

Why do we care about retinal models? We can undesrtand a lot, but there's a lot that we don't. 
Bridge between physiology and a computational account of what the brain does 

2. Actually say on the slide the point I'm making 
Explain/show/say what they're supposed to learn from it, instead of telling what its about. 

4 effects don't just look like filtering, thse are cool complicated effects 

Explain convolution as mosaic. We have 1 receptive field replicated in space, here and here and here.
