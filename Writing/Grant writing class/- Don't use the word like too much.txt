- Don't use the word "like" too much
** - Slow down my speech!!! 
- Don't move around the stage
- I use the laseer pointer too much - be more intentional about it. Say "Upper left" instead, par example. 
- Look at the audience 

-------------
Presentation 

Gap in knowledge could have been more clear
Simple animations to show part of the image, instead of showing all right away

Having a summary slide would have been nice - before results, include INCs 

Future direciton slide would have been nice


Jorg: SHould have been a slide about limitations 
Limitations of comparisons of amacrine vs model interneurons. 

I should ahve been more clear that this is non-trivial 
Experimentalists wanna hear about ways to falsify models. 

Refer how paper fits in the whole picture at the end of the talk
