Stronger connection between central hypothesis and aim 23 (motion and time). 

Explain correlations better, don't use high vs low. 
Give more context about motion, what people tried whby it failed etc.

Central hypothesis is not a new hypothesis 

Two aspects of ivison we don't understand very well are color and motion. The reason is that efficient coding
doesn't work as well because the information is redundant. 


Efficient coding is well validated
but the traditional way of thinking about efficient coding is that it needs to conserve energy
Efficient coding is why you get those very paradoxical representations as early as the reinta. 

Steve's advice: Have a more biological spin on it

Major issue: People don't understand 
Need less jargon (e.g. space time separability, etc)

End of aim 2, I never introduced why motion is receptive field changes across time. 

Kate: Not clear what's new about this project
Correlation and efficient coding doesn't stand out enough; how is it novel?
