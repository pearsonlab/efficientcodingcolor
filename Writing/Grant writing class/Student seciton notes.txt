- Lack of understanding alternative hypotheses.


- Aim 1 was very grounded in litterature. Like the RGC-cone ratios to explain differences in midget cells. Cool hypothesis
- However can't say the same about Aim 2. Its a bit more iffy
I don't talk about ON-DGCs. There are 3 classes that I don't talk about.

DSGC are very rare. If this was something that was really related to EC, then they would be highly conserved across species.
** Need more justification from litterature for Aim 2. 

Lack of overall framework that binds Aim 1 and Aim 2 together. 
** Need to talk about correlated channels more!!!

Innovation talks about challenge of fitting more parameters
Could talk more about what these parameters are, why nobody has done that before and how we're gonna fix it.

Its good that we use large databases of natural images and natural movies. 

***Problem with approach: No suggestion of alternative hypotheses
What are we going to do if the RGC ratio hypothesis does not work. How do we troubleshoot this?
There are a lot of knobs to tweak in this kind of work, but I don't talk about that! 

*Reviewer got confused about how I downsample. She thought I was squishing all pixels into 16x16.

*I don't explain how I'm going to deal about multiple filters in Aim 2. 

*Worries about whether this approach only gives me linear filters.

Daniel Marshall:
SIgnificance was clear. Lost a reviewer during approach.
Was hard to relate the approach to what was explained in significance. 

Approach does not speak about any anticipated problems. 
There are parametrization choices I specify in approach that I don't back up, or explain why we do it this way.

Alev Brigande:
Overaching framework is missing. 
**What we'll be able to do after. Future approaches
How is this going to move the field forward

Steve: Probability of a good grade is always better with a long answer
I need to use all 7 pages. 
Worried about parametrization of DoG RFs
I need to justify it better!! Show preliminary results, that it always converges to that anyways 
Lindsey: Not clear how you can get direction-selectiviy from DoG. 

**Big point to panel: Grant needs to give better tutorial for approach!!
Research is outside of panel's expertise

Approach was more like a summary of the methods. ITs a refresher for people in the field

Lindsey: Significance was expecting another paragraph. About methods previously used from the lab, what we're going to do, etc. 
Need to think about audience when you're writing. 

Lindsey: Figure 3 needs more explanation about how it relates to Aim 1 and Aim 2. Was not clear how this relates to cones.
