Proposed project will make a great contribution to the field


- Directed vs undirected learning 
medial preoptic area (POM) is involved in singing
Lesion in A11 (group midbrain dopamine cells) = no directed singing
What circuits for undirected singing?
Investigate output of POMs 

Aim 1: Identify POM subtypes in directed and undirected learning
3 groups: directed Singing, undirected singing, not singing, 

Aim 2: Necessity and sufficiency of POM for learning (CELLREADR)
Hypothesize that POM -> A11 = directed
POM -> VTA undirected

Significance was good. Aim 2 could have been emphasized better.

Approach
Aim 1: Clearly explained. Improvement of 45 mins explanation

Aim 2: Well explained, seems promising
This project is highly innovative, and will probably contribute 
greatly to the litterature

Review:
- They improved terminology about extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation
- Clarified that they can distinguish motivation vs ability to sing
- Previous concern about CellREADR. Explain that this is already working
