Johnâ€™s advice:
Color is about how we optimize different input channels 
So is motion? 
Details about midget cells (etc) goes in background, not in specific aims 
Present my project as something very general, 

Core: My project is about understanding how efficient coding works with different correlated channels 
Both correlated noise, color and motion fit in that problem 
Efficient coding has particularly been successful in vision 
Our lab showed that efficient coding model can be applicated in more complex scenarios to understand mosaics. Allows us to answer new questions
Most theoretical papers in vision assume that mosaics are infinite, assume linearity, etc. 

Predictive coding in retina: Stephanie Palmer 

Interesting idea: Some redundancy is useful because of noise, even though
