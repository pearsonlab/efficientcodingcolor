Its not clear why 2D models aren't good. What are the advantages of 3D models from a clinical perspective?
"The morphology under and between both contacts is likely relevant to the VNS response" 

Aim 1 and Aim 2 should be fused into one. 
Aim 3 depends on other people?? 


Many acronyms aren't defined: NEURON, COMSOL, EMG

The significance of ASCENT could be more clearly defined; how many people are using this software? 
Is this novel method only going to be used within the lab or is it already a thing? 

Its not clear to me whether we need to do the simulation for every vagus nerve or if what is found in this study
can generalize for the vagus nerve across people. 

Good: Statistical analyses are well-stated

Formula: Not well-defined, there's a typo.

How do we validate the 3D model? Only at the end of the project, Aim 3. 
Aims are dependent 

Significance:
This model can be used for other peripheral nerves!!

Grantsmanship:
---------------------

Significant from clinical perspective
Understanding this nerve has a lot of potential for curing depression, epilepsy, stroke rehabilitation.
This would allow to do better vagus nerve stimulations in humans
I like alternative solutions if they run out of RAM

Aims are very interdependent
This is a modeling study. I don't like the fact its only being validated against experimental data in 3rd aim. Back and forth between aim 1 and aim 3.   
Not clear how many people use the original ASCENT open-source software. 

#Explain the two parts of this nerve, good and bad. Its not very clear how 3D models are going to help us stimulate the good one and not the bad one. 


They collect their own data which is good.
