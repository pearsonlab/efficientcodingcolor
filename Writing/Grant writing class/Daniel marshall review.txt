Its not clear why 2D models aren't good. What are the advantages of 3D models from a clinical perspective?
"The morphology under and between both contacts is likely relevant to the VNS response" 

Aim 1 and Aim 2 should be fused into one. 
Aim 3 depends on other people?? 


Many acronyms aren't defined: NEURON, COMSOL, EMG

The significance of ASCENT could be more clearly defined; how many people are using this software? 
Is this novel method only going to be used within the lab or is it already a thing? 

Its not clear to me whether we need to do the simulation for every vagus nerve or if what is found in this study
can generalize for the vagus nerve across people. 

Good: Statistical analyses are well-stated

Formula: Not well-defined, there's a typo.

How do we validate the 3D model? - Aim 3
Aims are dependent 

Grantsmanship:
