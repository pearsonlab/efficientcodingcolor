- lTwo elements in significnace:
Efficient coding and rwhy the retina works that way.
They are intertwined, they should be more separated. 

After I say what the grant delivers, there's still more to say about significance. 
Where will the field be at after I'm done. What is new that will be possible? 
Cut out approach stuff and save it for approach section. 

Efficient coding is not how an engineer would have designed it. 

Give minimum background, and tell us how you're gonna davance that. 

Cool story for aim 1: 80% of midget cells are RGCs. 
If I want a cool story for aim 2: Why the hell would you encode motion in the retina?

It could be for two reasons: Either not everything is efficient, or model is wrong. 
Framing about testing which possibility is true. 

Use preliminary data in the approach. Explain how we're going to solve this provblem.
