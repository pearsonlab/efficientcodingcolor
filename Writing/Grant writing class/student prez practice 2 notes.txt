BAccus group: Specify which university they are from 

Being confident about what I Say 

Just transition from 2nd to 3rd slide 

Stop saying "These guys when describing anatomny" 
Explain why there's ON vs OFF pathway; ionotropic vs metabotropic receptors


Machine learning part: Could get through it faster (cool!)
Be more clear about why the computational model matters; prediction to other stimuli. Could mention natural scenes. 

Explain more clearly why there's a nonlinearity in the GLM.

*** DOn't forget to truncate the graph on slide 10 

Explain retinal reliability better - its the best the model can do accounting for internal noise 

use notes to transition between slides :) 

Advice for machine learning: Walk them through, more casually
Layers 1 and 2. 8 filters, each is a cell type with a difference receptive field that you convolve across the image. 

Random walk: Mention this is how the eyes move sooner 

Kate: Need to mention subunit in slide 11. 

Mention there are some subunits with a really good fit, some with a bad fit 

For Kate: Mentio0n Taylor expansion 

The idea behind latency coding and motion reversal kind of contradict each other 

Slide 27, remove the fact they repeat the dark pattern after the spike. ITs confusing 

Kate, VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure title is at same place in EVERY slide 

Add more points to rigor and reproducibility 
How coudl the design be improved
